# FinalProjectComp250

This was the final project for my Intro to Computer Science class that I took in the Winter 2021 semester at McGill university. 

The project was simple, implement a function Solve() which solves a sudoku that was provided. All functions to get our program to understand the given sudoku were provided.

Making a backtracking algorithm is simple enough, but the challenge was that it also had to solve 4x4 and 5x5 sudokus in under ten seconds.

For reference the first time that I allowed a very simple backtracking algorithm to try to solve the 4x4 it took it over 12 hours.

In the end I spent significant time implementing helper functions that were able to eliminate possibilities as well as place certain digits by using human sudoku solving techniques.
